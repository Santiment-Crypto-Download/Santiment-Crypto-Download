## ‚ùì What is Santiment?

Santiment is a comprehensive market intelligence platform that combines on-chain data, social media sentiment, and development activity tracking to help traders and investors make smarter crypto decisions. It offers real-time insights into market trends, investor behavior, and blockchain network health.

The platform provides access to over 2,000 crypto asset metrics, including whale transaction tracking, token circulation, exchange flow analysis, and developer activity. By combining blockchain analytics with crowd sentiment and behavioral data, Santiment delivers a unique perspective on market psychology and potential price movements.

Santiment's flagship product, **Sanbase**, features powerful charting tools, customizable dashboards, and detailed analytics for Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, and DeFi tokens. It also integrates with social data streams, tracking discussions and sentiment shifts across Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, and other platforms to detect emerging trends before they hit the mainstream.

With its alerting system, users can set up notifications for on-chain anomalies, social activity spikes, or developer commits. This makes it a valuable tool for spotting early signs of market reversals, accumulation phases, or sell-offs.

Used by retail traders, analysts, and institutional teams, Santiment bridges the gap between raw blockchain data and actionable market intelligence.
